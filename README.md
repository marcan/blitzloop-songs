## BlitzLoop public song repository

This repository contains songs whose authors have given permission for them to
be used with BlitzLoop.

### License

Unless otherwise stated for a specific included song, these songs may only be
used under the following conditions:

* You may only use these songs with BlitzLoop (or a fork that does not
  materially change the purpose of the software).

  i.e. don't just rip the audio files and stick them in your music player.

* You may perform these songs, privately or publicly, using BlitzLoop, as long
  as no fee is charged for the performance, nor for any event that advertises
  such performance.
  
  i.e. it's fine to run a BlitzLoop instance for your friends with these songs,
  or even an unofficial one inside a paid event, but do not run a commercial
  karaoke bar nor advertise BlitzLoop as a feature of a paid event if you're
  using these songs.

* You may record or allow performances to be recorded, and those recordings to
  be published, only if such performances include actual singing mixed with the
  original song audio.
  
  i.e. no just using `render.py` and uploading the output into YouTube, or
  otherwise making a clean recording of the songs.

* You may not redistribute these songs outside of machines you own. If you want
  to share them, please direct people to this repository instead.
  
  As an exception, you may distribute this repository as part of a BlitzLoop
  setup such as a stand-alone machine or pre-configured storage, only via direct
  action, such as giving such a machine to another person, if you ensure they
  are aware of these terms.
  
  As an exception, you may fork this repository on GitHub, for the purposes of
  making PRs against the upstream repo, as long as the GitHub fork metadata is
  intact and points to this repo.
  
  i.e. no rehosting the repo. You can give a NUC containing this to a friend as
  long as they know the rules.

+ You may write and distribute scripts that automatically fetch and use this
  repository, as long as this notice is shown to users of such scripts.
  
  i.e. it's fine to make a standalone BlitzLoop setup installer that clones this
  repo, but make sure your users know about the terms.

* You may not remove or alter any of the credits information contained in the
  songs.

  If you notice a mistake in the credits, please open a PR against this repo.

* You may not modify the audio/video/graphic data of these songs.

* You may modify the lyrics data to make stylistic or timing changes, translate
  the lyrics, etc. as long as such modified versions are clearly marked.

  If you notice timing issues or typos, please open a PR against this repo.

The point of having these strict baseline terms is to increase the chances that
artists will allow their songs to be used with BlitzLoop.
